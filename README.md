### Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

## Optimizations

I could add more specific ramdpmized possibilties based off various combinations of choices rather than the most selected.

## Lessons Learned:

Reinforced the Separation of Concerns. Used applications of Math.Random to generate name. Reinforced understanding of arrays.
